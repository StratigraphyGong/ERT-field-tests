# ERT-field-tests
ERT data obtained from field tests
The open source datasets are composed of two parts: 
        part 1. the measurement result;
        part 2. the inverse result.

The profiles of the logarithm of the electrical resistivity, log(r), mentioned in the manuscript is drawn with inverse result (part 2).

The relationship between part 1 and part 2: 
        the inverse result（part 2） is derived based on the measurement result (part 1), through inverse analysis, with the aid of the software, Geogiga RImager 6.0 software;
        differen inverse methods and parameter setting may lead to different different inverse result.

        
In summary,
       If you want to use the results in the manusctipt,  download part 2;
       If you want to conduct some inverse analysis by yourself, download part1;
